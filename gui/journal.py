that I need to put all of my thoughts
down on paper and try to look at what
happened recently, see a bigger picture...

About a month ago social networks gave
birth to a new flow of videos. People were
filming streets, talking about some kind
of orange mist. But there was no mist!
What they were trying to film was only
buildings, cars, sidewalks, and crystal
clear air. Like they were hallucinating.

It all looked as a new stupid joke from
those internet guys, but in some moment
they started to find bodies... More and
more: people were dying right on a street,
but no one was able to say why! Here
someone noticed: bodies appearing in
regions where that orange mist was spotted.

As it usually happens, government first
tried to hide the adversities scale. They
started to close city blocks, speak of
stupid explanations, while in Germany,
Switzerland, Netherlands more and more
bodies were appearing, more and more
orange mist reports were happening.

Finally, several police officers, seeing
that the disaster is gaining momentum,
decided to whistleblow. Photos they
posted publicly were showing tens of dead
bodies on streets, and several documents,
where chemical specialists were summaring
up that the orange mist, called by them
as "The Stench", selectively kills people,
no matter how good is their isolation
or air filtering...

This action caused panic to stroke most
of the Europe countries, and in this
moment I reilized I should do something.""",
