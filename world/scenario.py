the right of you. "Captain, we probably have a trouble." You're
uppering a spoon full of dry porridge to your mouth: "Yeah?!"
"Yeah. Come see me after you sna—Åk is over." He gets up and
leaves the deckhouse. Finishing the awfully tasteless portion,
you're walking to the lower level of the Adjutant. Before you
pronounce the first word, Kenneth rises his finger up, asking
you to stay silent and listen. You're concentrating on the noises...
"Hear that?" - the mechanic points to the left side of the room,
and you understand what he's trying to say. Some metal screeching
can be heard from the wall. "That's an axle box, something's
acting up." - Kenneth explains silently. - "We need to check
it, and it'll take some time." You're trying to remember how far
was the Stench frontier, when you last heard about it. "Our
options?" Looking at you, Kenneth calculates something in his
mind and then tells: "We need five hours long stop to deal with
the axle box." It's much. "Other options?" The mechanic seems
to be not very pleasant to say it, but he does: "We can try
to do it on move. But that's dangerous, and will required two
men - me here and someone on the other side of the locomotive.
The second guy can get injured I warn you. Anyway I think not
dealing with it can cause us troubles as well. Your call, Captain." """,

by Kenneth. Seeing that they are okay to fix the trouble
without you, you return to the deckhouse and turn on radio.
"The Stench clouds were noticed in Stuttgart! On the south
of the city several people already found dead, others leaving
their homes, trying to get out of the city. Stay on this
station, we'll keep you posted!" Stuttgart. Looks like the
Stench frontier moves from south-east direction. It should
be considered while planning the further route... Four hours
passed, and the crew reports you that the axle box is good
to go. Calling everyone back on board, you're commanding to
continue the road in the same moment. Four hours is not five,
but it's still long, very long. Better keep your pace high now.

see Kenneth taking one of the fighters with him to the
lower level of the Adjutant. For several long hours they
slip out of your radars... Exiting on the fresh air, you
incline above the railings and see a blood spot on one of
the wheels, blinking on every turnover. Without delays you
go to find the mechanic. Kenneth, seeing you concerned,
uppers his hands in the same moment: "It's okay, it's okay!
Small wound, but the axle box is fine now. Nothing serious!"
Making a deep breath, you nod your head, trying to calm
down. You knew the risks from the beginning, but it's still
about your people safety. It's good that the helper didn't
get serious wounds. You better find him or her later to

understand that you can't afford even three hours. Too risky,
in these days it's better to keep some spare time. Returning
back to Kenneth, you tell him to ignore the noises for now.
He doesn't like your decision very much, you can see it on
his face, but your common past outweighs everything. You
helped him and his family more times than you both can count,

meadow, you understand that there are mostly children. Weird!
Asking a couple of teammates to follow you, you get closer
to the crowd, seeing a woman moving towards your party. In
a few words she tells that they are workers and children
from an orphan shelter. Understanding that the Stench moves
fast to the place, and the governors are too busy saving
themselves, adults, who worked there, gathered all the
children and decided to move to Silewer on foot. Looking at
pale and tired children, you silently think that it was really
tough idea. But probably the decision saved their lives...
Complaining about walking for six hours without a stop, the
woman asks you to help them build a field camp. You understand
that it'll take a lot of time, as there are about sixty
children. On the other hand, it doesn't look right to just
leave them here, in the foreign country, tired and
shelterless. Maybe there is some time to help them a little?""",

will be useful for the crew as well... It takes you about two
hours to finish preparing the camp. Getting a lot of thanks
from the children and their teachers, you gather again on the
Adjutant. Everyone seems to be enlivened, still, the road calls.
Giving an order to start engine, you approach a couple of your
teammates, who are looking some kind of an article on a
martphone. "Hey, Captain, you need to see this! Some of those
children visited kinda research center a month ago and took
an interview there. The woman speaks about interesting things."

supposed source in Germany. Overthinking it again, again and
again, you decide to ignore the teachers plea. The crew don't
like the decision very much, but everyone mind the situation.

say those orphans that you're going to leave. "So, what?" - you
ask quietly. - "Should we continue the road without the last
word? What's the point in it?" Your teammates lower their
eyes and nod their heads. Taking this as an answer, you give
a command to go...

Some time later you see a paper on your table. Running through
it with your eyes, you find out it's an interview log. Those
