the right of you. "Captain, we probably have a trouble." You're
uppering a spoon full of dry porridge to your mouth: "Yeah?!"
"Yeah. Come see me after you sna—Åk is over." He gets up and
leaves the deckhouse. Finishing the awfully tasteless portion,
you're walking to the lower level of the Adjutant. Before you
pronounce the first word, Kenneth rises his finger up, asking
you to stay silent and listen. You're concentrating on the noises...
"Hear that?" - the mechanic points to the left side of the room,
and you understand what he's trying to say. Some metal screeching
can be heard from the wall. "That's an axle box, something's
acting up." - Kenneth explains silently. - "We need to check
it, and it'll take some time." You're trying to remember how far
was the Stench frontier, when you last heard about it. "Our
options?" Looking at you, Kenneth calculates something in his
mind and then tells: "We need five hours long stop to deal with
the axle box." It's much. "Other options?" The mechanic seems
to be not very pleasant to say it, but he does: "We can try
to do it on move. But that's dangerous, and will required two
men - me here and someone on the other side of the locomotive.
The second guy can get injured I warn you. Anyway I think not
dealing with it can cause us troubles as well. Your call, Captain." """,

crew starts to work without delays. Dismantling the axle box,
you see that a couple of details do not fit each other, and
rub hard. Your people start to deal with the problem, leaded
by Kenneth. Seeing that they are okay to fix the trouble
without you, you return to the deckhouse and turn on radio.
"The Stench clouds were noticed in Stuttgart! On the south
of the city several people already found dead, others leaving
their homes, trying to get out of the city. Stay on this
station, we'll keep you posted!" Stuttgart. Looks like the
Stench frontier moves from south-east direction. It should
be considered while planning the further route... Four hours
passed, and the crew reports you that the axle box is good
to go. Calling everyone back on board, you're commanding to
continue the road in the same moment. Four hours is not five,
but it's still long, very long. Better keep your pace high now.

You're returning back to the deckhouse, and some time later
see Kenneth taking one of the fighters with him to the
lower level of the Adjutant. For several long hours they
slip out of your radars... Exiting on the fresh air, you
incline above the railings and see a blood spot on one of
the wheels, blinking on every turnover. Without delays you
go to find the mechanic. Kenneth, seeing you concerned,
uppers his hands in the same moment: "It's okay, it's okay!
Small wound, but the axle box is fine now. Nothing serious!"
Making a deep breath, you nod your head, trying to calm
down. You knew the risks from the beginning, but it's still
about your people safety. It's good that the helper didn't
get serious wounds. You better find him or her later to
say your thanks.

understand that you can't afford even three hours. Too risky,
in these days it's better to keep some spare time. Returning
back to Kenneth, you tell him to ignore the noises for now.
He doesn't like your decision very much, you can see it on
his face, but your common past outweighs everything. You
helped him and his family more times than you both can count,
so he's not going to argue with you...

Some time later you'll understand that the problem was not
one of those to be ignored. The axle box will be damaged.
