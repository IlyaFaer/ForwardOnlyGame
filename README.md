# Forward Only
[на русском](https://github.com/IlyaFaer/ForwardOnlyGame/blob/master/README%20(RUS).md)

The Europe is stroke by the terrible cataclysm called "the Stench". The only way to survive it is to flee and do it quickly, as death spreads irrepressibly. Fortunately, you have a locomotive that is still running, so gather your crew and travel through the Silewer - country full of skinheads, who struggle against the avalanche of refugees from Europe.

The game represents a route-strategy with arcade fight blotches. Find an optimal way through the inimical Silewer before the fast spreading poisonous clouds of the Stench outrun you. Fights on move, locomotive upgrades, tough decisions, recruiting, diseases, resources searches and even more await you in the game.
