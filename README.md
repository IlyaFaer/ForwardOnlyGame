# ForwardOnly

The World dies because of the terrible cataclysm, and the only way to survive is to move forward and do it quickly, as death spreads across Earth. Fortunately, you have a locomotive that is still running, so prepare for a big journey with a small company of heroes, who are trying to pull through the severe adversities new World brings upon.

**The Project legal status**  
The Game is an author product, its usement is regulated by the License. No contributing will be accepted. However, the Game is an open source project - you can track its development progress, use the Source Code for self-educating and reproduce programming techniques used in the Game Source Code - it's the main purpose of open sourcing the Game. Still the Source Code itself, models and other resources used in this Work are protected by copyrights.

If you're a player, you're welcome to play the Game any way you like without any restrictions and time limits.

**Current stage**  
The game is at a very early development stage (~12% finished). It's developed on Python 3.7 and Panda3D game engine. All the models are created with Blender and MakeHuman.

You can see the current stage status and plans for the Game in Projects tab. There are many ideas, but it requires some time to implement them all. Most part of the plan is not yet publically proclaimed, as it is still work in progress.

For now the game includes:
- Train movement system
- some camera controls
- day-night change cycle and shadows
- one location of the World, which is randomly built on every game start
- simple characters and characters manipulating system

**Tip**: use F1 key while in Game to see the controls list.

The Game is not yet built from the Source Code into the final state, so the only way to play it is to install Python 3.7 and Panda3D game engine (version 1.10.5 is recommended), and run it from the Source Code.

As the Game is Git-tracked from the very beginning, you have an opportunity to see the whole progress of development starting from the very first line of code, and even run the eldest versions of the Game. Hope, this will help you to build you own game development process.

**Feedback**  
Contributing to the Game will not be accepted, but you're welcome to open an issue with a proposition, bug report, question, or observation, it'll surely get attention.
