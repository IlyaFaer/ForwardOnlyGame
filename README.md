# Forward Only
[на русском](https://github.com/IlyaFaer/ForwardOnlyGame/blob/master/README%20(RUS).md)

The World dies because of the terrible cataclysm called "the Stench". The only way to survive is to move and do it quickly, as death spreads across the Earth. Fortunately, you have a locomotive that is still running, so prepare for a big journey in small company of cohesive heroes, who are trying to pull through severe adversities new World brings upon.

The game represents a route-strategy with arcade fights blotches. Search for an optimal way through the world, while fast spreading poisonous clouds of the Stench will force you to keep your pace high. There will be enemies, who'll do the best to stop you, diseases, tough decisions to make, resources searches, recruiting, cities where you can upgrade your locomotive with active guns and even more.
