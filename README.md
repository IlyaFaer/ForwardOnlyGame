# ForwardOnly

The World dies because of the terrible cataclysm called Stench - poisonous clouds that are ushering people to death with every single breath. The only way to survive is to move forward and do it quickly, as Stench spreads across Earth. Fortunately, you have a locomotive that is still running, so prepare for a big journey with a small company of heroes, who are trying to pull through the severe adversities new World brings upon.

**Current stage**  
The game is at a very early development stage (~8% done). It's developed on Python 3.7 and Panda3D game engine. All the models are created with Blender.

You can see the current stage plans in Projects tab. There are many ideas for the game, but it requires some time to implement them all. If you're interested in contributing, pushing the game forward, take any of the current issues and provide your changes with a PR! If you have an interesting idea, or you just want to add a new model, graphical effect, or somethings else, create an issue.

*Please, be careful with any changes you're proposing. Game is a big and difficult program, in which problem can occur everywhere. I hope, you and me both don't want lags, graphical artifacts, twitches, freezes, logical mistakes, and other stuff.*

For now the game has a Train movement system, some camera controls, and one location of the World that is build randomly with all of its environment models.

**Plans**  
Short story of what the game should be: big roguelike challenge, in which you have to make a lot of choices on very suprising situations, manage your resources, skill your characters, customize Train, explore the randomly built World, fight with different fractions, and always be on a move to avoid Stench.
