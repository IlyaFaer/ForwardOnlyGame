# ForwardOnly

The World dies because of the terrible cataclysm called "the Stench". The only way to survive it is to move forward and do it quickly, as death spreads across the Earth. Fortunately, you have a locomotive that is still running, so prepare for a big journey with a small company of cohesive heroes, who are trying to pull together through the severe adversities new World brings upon.

**The Project legal status**  
The Game is an author product, its use is regulated by [the License](https://github.com/IlyaFaer/ForwardOnlyGame/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

**Current stage**  
The Game is at an development stage (~40% finished). It's developed on Python 3.7 and Panda3D game engine, models are created with Blender and MakeHuman.

You can see the current status and plans for the Game in Projects tab. Most part of the plan is not yet publicly proclaimed, as some details are still work in progress.

The major features the Game includes now:
- Raider and Soldier character classes (both with male/female genders), which have different tactical preferences
- traits, making characters stronger or weaker in different situations
- cohesion system which makes characters tougher together and unlocks powerful team skills
- real-time strategic fights with enemies of three classes
- cities, where you can use money to restore your team and the Train
- outings, deteriorated rails, randomly build world, etc.

The Game builds are not yet publicly accessible (are undergoing closed testing), thus, the only way to play it (yet) is to install Python 3.7 and Panda3D game engine (version 1.10.5 is recommended), and run it from the source code.
