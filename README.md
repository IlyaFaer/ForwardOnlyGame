# ForwardOnly

The World dies because of the terrible cataclysm, and the only way to survive is to move forward and do it quickly, as death spreads across Earth. Fortunately, you have a locomotive that is still running, so prepare for a big journey with a small company of heroes, who are trying to pull through the severe adversities new World brings upon.

**The Project legal status**
The Game is an author product, its use is regulated by [the License](https://github.com/IlyaFaer/ForwardOnlyGame/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

**Current stage**
The game is at a very early development stage (~18% finished). It's developed on Python 3.7 and Panda3D game engine, models are created with Blender and MakeHuman.

You can see the current stage status and plans for the Game in Projects tab. Most part of the plan is not yet publicly proclaimed, as it is still work in progress.

For now the Game includes:
- Train movement system
- some camera and Train controls
- one location of the World, which is randomly built on every game start
- characters with some behavior and characters manipulating system
- simple enemies, enemy attacks and common shooting system

**Tip**: use F1 key while in Game to see the controls list.

The Game is not yet built from the source code into the final state, so the only way to play it is to install Python 3.7 and Panda3D game engine (version 1.10.5 is recommended), and run it from the source code.
