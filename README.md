# ForwardOnly

The World dies because of the terrible cataclysm, and the only way to survive is to move forward and do it quickly, as death spreads across Earth. Fortunately, you have a locomotive that is still running, so prepare for a big journey with a small company of heroes, who are trying to pull through the severe adversities new World brings upon.

**The Project legal status**  
The Game is an author product, its use is regulated by [the License](https://github.com/IlyaFaer/ForwardOnlyGame/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

**Current stage**  
The Game is at an early development stage (~37% finished). It's developed on Python 3.7 and Panda3D game engine, models are created with Blender and MakeHuman.

You can see the current stage status and plans for the Game in Projects tab. Most part of the plan is not yet publicly proclaimed, as it is still work in progress.

For now the Game includes:
- the World randomly built on a game start
- scripted outings, on which you must send right people to get resources
- cohesion system that makes characters stronger together and unlocks powerful team skills
- two classes of characters (plus male/female genders), which have different preferences for fighting, outings and cohesion
- cities, where you can use money to restore your team and train condition
- real-time strategic fights with rivals of two classes
- tactical elements: track your people energy level to keep them efficient, consider character's condition and class when sending him for an outing, decide at which train part a unit will be more useful during fight, etc.

The Game is not yet built from the source code into the final state, so the only way to play it is to install Python 3.7 and Panda3D game engine (version 1.10.5 is recommended), and run it from the source code.
