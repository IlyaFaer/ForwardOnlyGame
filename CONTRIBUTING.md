# Contributing

Since version 3 of the Game License, Forward Only opened its doors for anyone who wants to contribute into the project. Several conditions:

- By contributing, contributor doesn't become The Game owner/shareholder. All the contributions become a part of The Game.
- All contributions must be made with a pull request and reviewed by the project owner @IlyaFaer.
- If a contributed resource is not authored by the contributor, documents allowing the use of the resource by its author must be provided.
- In case the contributor proposes something not related to any opened issues, they should describe changes in the pull request.
- Contributions of any kind allowed: programming, sounds, GUI and graphic changes, 3D models, etc.
- Contributions to The Game scenario are allowed, but should be preliminary discussed and reviewed by the project owner @IlyaFaer.
- Contributor should use `black` code formatter, write Napoleon style docstrings, comments for complex parts of code and test the proposed changes.

**Designs**  
For a better understanding of the game mechanics and decisions motivation, it's recommended to read the game design documents:

[Common design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mP6REhmcjmnTMd7RIeM7J7_xRfhEK03xHokBGXRsMJA/edit?usp=sharing) - includes notes and ideas for the next game episodes, and description of the overall game basics.  
[1st Episode design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eNtLjyEPr-M8RvDVAJ8ffXeJU2_JWAe2EDiHajv5Z1E/edit?usp=sharing) - includes detailed description of the game mechanics and decisions motivation.

[Forward Only: Outgunned](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16kWcF0M_QtYErzm4sUlH8Z-wri4WPNVV2cKuUIvLcHY/edit?usp=sharing) - a Forward Only spin-off arcade game + NFT idea.
